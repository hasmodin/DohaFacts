        <h2>Do You Know ? About Qatar</h2>
    </div>


    <div class="about-qatar-text">
        <p class="abt-qatar">Qatar is the small country on the east of the <b>Arabian peninsula.</b> It's like a thumb jutting out into the <b>Persian Gulf,</b>
        with warm water all around. <b>Doha</b> is the capital city, and it's a really cool place to visit. It's got tall buildings that touch 
        the sky, fancy museums with treasures from all over the world, and a long sidewalk along the water called the <b>Corniche</b> where you can take a walk and enjoy the view.</p>

        <p class="abt-qatar">But Qatar isn't just about the city. There's a lot of desert there too, with big sand dunes that look like golden waves. 
            You can go on a safari in a jeep and see camels, or even ride one yourself! There are also old ruins of a city called <b>Zubarah</b>, where people used to live hundreds of years ago and trade pearls.
             And if you like birds, there's a special place called <b>Al Thakira</b> where you can see flamingos and other pretty birds flying around.</p>

             <p class="abt-qatar">The people in Qatar are very friendly and welcoming. They have a special way of making you feel at home, even if you're from far away. They love to share their culture with visitors, so you might get invited to have some strong coffee called <b>"Karak"</b> and sweet dumplings called <b>"Luqaimat"</b> with them. You might even see them do a traditional dance called <b>"Ardah"</b> where they clap and sing and stomp their feet.</p>
             <p class="abt-qatar">Qatar is also a country that's looking to the future. They're building a new city called <b>Lusail</b> that's going to be really high-tech and eco-friendly. And they hosted the <b>FIFA World Cup in 2022</b>, so they built some amazing stadiums that look like spaceships!</p>
             <p class="abt-qatar">So, if you're looking for a place to visit that's got something for everyone, Qatar is a great choice. You can see modern <b>cities</b>, explore the <b>desert</b>, learn about old <b>cultures</b>, and make new friends. It's a small country with a big <b>heart</b>, and it's sure to leave you with memories that will last a lifetime.</p>
